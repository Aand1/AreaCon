AreaCon is primarily a numerical implementation of the algorithms found in the following:

  abstract =	 {We consider the problem of optimal coverage with
                  area-constraints in a mobile multi-agent system.
                  For a planar environment with an associated density
                  function, this problem is equivalent to dividing the
                  environment into optimal subregions such that each
                  agent is responsible for the coverage of its own
                  region.  In this paper, we design a continuous-time
                  distributed policy which allows a team of agents to
                  achieve a convex area-constrained partition of a
                  convex workspace.  Our work is related to the
                  classic Lloyd algorithm, and makes use of
                  generalized Voronoi diagrams.  We also discuss
                  practical implementation for real mobile networks.
                  Simulation methods are presented and discussed.},

<h3>
<a id="Usage" class="anchor" href="#Usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Usage</h3>

<p>To use AreaCon in your C++ program:
<ol>
  <li> Download the AreaCon library using the links at the top of the page.</li>
  <li> Unzip and extract the files,</li>
  <li> Place an #include "areacon.hpp" directive at the beginning of your program, and</li>
  <li> Link your code with "areacon.cpp" and "clipper.cpp" when compiling.</li>
</ol>
You can now use AreaCon in your program!
<br>
<br>
AreaCon can be used in a variety of different ways. However, general calls to AreaCon for use in area-constrained partitioning will usually follow these basic steps:
<ol>
  <li> Define the region to be partitioned, the number of regions to be used, and the desired areas of the resultant regions</li>
  <li> Define the density vector (<a href="#Math">discussion</a>)</li>
  <li> Create and Initialize a partition object, and</li>
  <li> Call the "CalculatePartition" function.</li>
</ol>
That's all there is to it! Note that AreaCon can also be used for a variety of other basic geometric operations, e.g., finding centroids. Detailed source code documentation is included in pdf form with the AreaCon download, or can be found <a href="./Documentation/index.html"> here</a>. Some useful tips and troubleshooting advice can be found on the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> page, and more detailed discussion about the functionality of AreaCon can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/jrpeters/AreaCon/wiki"> Wiki</a>.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Authors" class="anchor" href="#Authors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p> The AreaCon library's core components were written and developed by <a href = "http://engineering.ucsb.edu/~jrpeters">Jeffrey R. Peters</a> (@jrpeters), with helpful insight from a variety of people including Amit Surana, William Sisson, Alexander Shilov, Grant Taylor, Terry Turpin, Rush Patel, and Francesco Bullo. The algorithms used by area-con are based primarily off of work by Rush Patel, Paolo Frasca, and Francesco Bullo (see References).</p>

<p> To report a bug, suggest a fix, or contribute to the project, please visit the AreaCon GitHub page. Additional usage examples or code-snippets are also appreciated and can be added to the Wiki page. </p>

<p>Questions or comments can also be sent directly to me via email, but please check the FAQ page and the AreaCon Wiki first to make sure that the issue hasn't already been addressed. 
I also welcome any general comments or suggestions on how to improve the code.</p>
