<a id="About" class="anchor" href="#About" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About AreaCon.</h3>

AreaCon is a free open source C++ library for performing area-constrained partitioning operations on convex, 2D polygonal regions. It is intended primarily for use in robot and mobile sensor network applications in which the workspace is to be divided among the available agents in an optimal way. AreaCon allows the user to specify the final weighted area of each of the resultant regions, thus providing a natural load-balancing that is useful in a variety of static and dynamic coverage applications, as well as a variety of applications that involve optimal division of workload. Specifically, given a prior density defined over a polygonal region of interest, AreaCon provides a numerical implementation of a theoretically rigorous, bio-inspired algorithm that systematically divides the region into a set of disjoint, convex, and centroidal regions with pre-specified areas. The entire library consists of a single compilation unit (one .hpp and one .cpp file), which has dependence on a single free and open source third party library (the <a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php"> Polygon Clipper Library</a>). It can therefore be seamlessly integrated into larger, more complex planning codes that require simple load-balancing steps without the weight of a larger computational geometry library. 
<br>
<br>
<strong> AreaCon v.1</strong> provides the following on planar, convex polygonal environments:
<ul>
  <li>Area-constrained partitioning over arbitrary density functions</li>
  <li>Centroid computation</li>
  <li>A variety of useful geometric structures and associated functions</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that although AreaCon only provides explicit support for convex polygonal environments, it supports arbitrary density functions. Therefore, the library can also be used for partitioning on a much larger class of planar environments by strategically defining regions of zero density. Exact or arbitrary precision arithmetic is avoided for additional robustness in numerical implementation. However, functionality is still somewhat sensitive to a variety of algorithmic parameters (step-sizes, stopping-criteria, integration parameters, etc.). If these parameters are chosen poorly or the scale of the underlying density varies wildly, the library can and will return errors. Despite this, if parameters are chosen properly the library will produce high-quality results for a number of environments and densities. In addition, reasonable results can be obtained for most "regular" workspaces using the provided default parametric values.

<p>Weâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="Authors" class="anchor" href="#Authors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p> The AreaCon library's core components were written and developed by <a href = "http://engineering.ucsb.edu/~jrpeters">Jeffrey R. Peters</a> (@jrpeters), with helpful insight from a variety of people including Amit Surana, William Sisson, Alexander Shilov, Grant Taylor, Terry Turpin, Rush Patel, and Francesco Bullo. The algorithms used by area-con are based primarily off of work by Rush Patel, Paolo Frasca, and Francesco Bullo (see References).</p>

<p> To report a bug, suggest a fix, or contribute to the project, please visit the AreaCon GitHub page. Additional usage examples or code-snippets are also appreciated and can be added to the Wiki page. </p>

<p>Questions or comments can also be sent directly to me via email, but please check the FAQ page and the AreaCon Wiki first to make sure that the issue hasn't already been addressed. 
I also welcome any general comments or suggestions on how to improve the code.</p>
