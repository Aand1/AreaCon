<a id="About" class="anchor" href="#About" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About AreaCon.</h3>

AreaCon is a free open source C++ library for performing area-constrained partitioning operations on convex, 2D polygonal regions. It is intended primarily for use in robot and mobile sensor network applications in which the workspace is to be divided among the available agents in an optimal way. AreaCon allows the user to specify the final weighted area of each of the resultant regions, thus providing a natural load-balancing that is useful in a variety of static and dynamic coverage applications, as well as a variety of applications that involve optimal division of workload. Specifically, given a prior density defined over a polygonal region of interest, AreaCon provides a numerical implementation of a theoretically rigorous, bio-inspired algorithm that systematically divides the region into a set of disjoint, convex, and centroidal regions with pre-specified areas. The entire library consists of a single compilation unit (one .hpp and one .cpp file), which has dependence on a single free and open source third party library (the <a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php"> Polygon Clipper Library</a>). It can therefore be seamlessly integrated into more complex planning codes that require simple load-balancing steps without the weight of a larger computational geometry library. 
<br>
<br>
<strong> AreaCon v.1</strong> provides the following on planar, convex polygonal environments:
<ul>
  <li>Area-constrained partitioning over arbitrary density functions</li>
  <li>Centroid computation</li>
  <li>A variety of useful geometric structures and associated functions</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that although AreaCon only provides explicit support for convex polygonal environments, it supports arbitrary density functions. Therefore, the library can also be used for partitioning on a much larger class of planar environments by strategically defining regions of zero density. Exact or arbitrary precision arithmetic is avoided for additional robustness in numerical implementation. However, functionality is still somewhat sensitive to a variety of algorithmic parameters (step-sizes, stopping-criteria, integration parameters, etc.). If these parameters are chosen poorly or the scale of the underlying density varies wildly, the library can and will return errors. Despite this, if parameters are chosen properly the library will produce high-quality results for a number of environments and densities. In addition, reasonable results can be obtained for most "regular" workspaces using the provided default parametric values.

<h3>
<a id="Usage" class="anchor" href="#Usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Usage</h3>

<p>To use AreaCon in your C++ program:
<ol>
  <li> Download the AreaCon library using the links at the top of the page.</li>
  <li> Unzip and extract the files,</li>
  <li> Place an #include "areacon.hpp" directive at the beginning of your program, and</li>
  <li> Link your code with "areacon.cpp" and "clipper.cpp" when compiling.</li>
</ol>
You can now use AreaCon in your program!
<br>
<br>
AreaCon can be used in a variety of different ways. However, general calls to AreaCon for use in area-constrained partitioning will usually follow these basic steps:
<ol>
  <li> Define the region to be partitioned, the number of regions to be used, and the desired areas of the resultant regions</li>
  <li> Define the density vector (<a href="#Math">discussion</a>)</li>
  <li> Create and Initialize a partition object, and</li>
  <li> Call the "CalculatePartition" function.</li>
</ol>
That's all there is to it! Note that AreaCon can also be used for a variety of other basic geometric operations, e.g., finding centroids. Detailed source code documentation is included in pdf form with the AreaCon download, or can be found <a href="./Documentation/index.html"> here</a>. Some useful tips and troubleshooting advice can be found on the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> page, and more detailed discussion about the functionality of AreaCon can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/jrpeters/AreaCon/wiki"> Wiki</a>.

<a id="Examples" class="anchor" href="#Examples" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Start Example</h3>
<p>In-depth discussions about usage including how to create polygons, define prior density functions, choose algorithmic parameters, and initialize partition objects, as well as some helpful numerical examples can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/jrpeters/AreaCon/wiki"> Wiki</a>. However, as a quick-start guide that will illustrate generic usage, we offer the following example.</p>

<p><strong> Partitioning Over a Uniform Prior:</strong> Consider a polygonal region with vertices (0,0), (5,0), (10,5), (10,10), (0,10) and uniform density. Suppose we wanted to partition the region into 3 disjoint sub-regions with relative (weighted) areas 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3. To perform this operation using AreaCon, simply run the following code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
//include the AreaCon header

#include areacon.h

using namespace AreaCon;

int main(void){

//Create the polygon to be partitioned (vertices must be listed 
in counter-clockwise order).
std::vector vertices = {Point(0,0), Point(5,0), Point(10,5), Point(10,10), Point(0,10)};
Poly Region(vertices);

//Define the number of regions and the desired areas
int NRegions = 3;
std::vector desired_area = {0.2, 0.5, 0.3};


//Create a uniform density grid (will be normalized automatically)
Nx = 100, Ny = 100;
std::vector values(10000,0.1);
Density Prior(Region, Nx, Ny, values);

//Create a partition object
Partition Example_Partition(NRegions, Prior, desired_area);

//Initialize the centers (generators) and weights (Here, we'll use default parameters).
Example_Partition.InitializePartition();

//Find Partition
Example_Partition.CalculatePartition(false);
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
That's it!! The resulting partition and generators are then stored in Example_Partition.Covering and Example_Partition.Centers, respectively, and can be accessed using the Partition::GetCovering and Partition::GetCenters functions. A plot of the result is shown below:
